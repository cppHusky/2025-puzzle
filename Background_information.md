Cardinals are created by the Pope. Only cardinals have the right to be elected as the **bishop of Rome (pope)** (in 16th century).

The order of cardinals are:

1. Cardinal bishops
1. Cardinal priests
1. Cardinal deacons

### Divisions among Cardinals

- **Carlo Borromeo**, nephew of Pius IV, followed by most creatures of Pius IV;
- **Michele Bonelli**, grand nephew of Pius V, the leader of cardinals elevated by Pius V;
- **Alessandro Farnese**, Grandson of Paul III, also supported by creatures of Paul III;
- **Alessandro de' Medici** *(unknown who)*, son of Duck Cosimo I de Medici, cares the interests of Grand Duchy of Tuscany;
- **Francisco Pacheco de Toledo** and **Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle** main representative of Philip II of Spain;
- **Charles d'Angennes de Rambouillet**, main representative of Charles IX of France.

Cardinals **Farnese**, **Savelli**, **Correggio**, **Ricci** and **Boncompagni** were considered as the main *papabili*.

Cardinal Farnese and **Cardinal Medici** are opponents because the rivelry between House Farnese and House Medici in Morthen Italy.

Philip II of Spain opposed Farnese's Candidature because he considered Farnese's elevation dangerous to the balance of power in Italy.

### The process of conclave

The conclave was held on May 12, 1572.

Granvelle informed Farnese that the King of Spain would not accept his election and to ask him to withdraw his candidature in order to maintain peace in Italy.

Farnese gave up, but wished to be able to use his influence effectively in choice of the new pontiff.

On May 13, the leaders of main factions (Farnese, Bonelli, Granvelle and Borromeo), agreed to elect **Ugo Boncompagni**.

The people of Rome welcomed the new pope, because he was neither religious nor an austere "Theatine", as most people had feared.
